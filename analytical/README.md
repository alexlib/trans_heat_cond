Analytical solutions for 1D transient heat conduction in a solid sphere, cylinder, or slab shape with convection at the surface and no heat generation.

### analytical.py
Compares the surface and center temperature profiles of a wood particle at fast pyrolysis conditions. Particle is represented as a solid sphere, cylinder, slab.

### bessel.py
Example of using SciPy for calculating bessel functions of the first kind. Compare to the values listed in the Bergman 2011 book.

### funcRoots.py
Function that returns the positive roots of the zeta, Bi equation used for the analytical theta solution.

### funcTheta.py
Function to return the theta (dimensionless temperature) profile at a certain dimensionless point (r) in a 1D solid sphere, cylinder, or slab shape.

### funcZeta.py
Functions for zeta, Bi equations for sphere, cylinder, and slab cases and required by the analytical solution.

### roots.py
Plots the zeta, Bi equation and its positive roots for the 1D sphere, cylinder, or slab cases.
