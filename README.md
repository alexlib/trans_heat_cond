## Models and Functions for 1D Transient Heat Conduction

Models and functions to simulate the 1D transient heat conduction of solid wood particles at fast pyrolysis conditions. The code is organized into 3 folders based on the approach or method used to calculate the heat conduction within a solid shape. Each folder (listed below) contains a **README** document to provide details about the files in that particular folder.

All code is written in Python 3 which can be easily installed using the free [Anaconda](http://www.continuum.io) distribution provided by Continuum Analytics. This distribution includes the required numerical libraries and plotting tools needed to run the models.

*Requirements: Python 3, NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib*

### analytical
