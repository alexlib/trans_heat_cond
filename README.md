# trans_heat_cond

1D transient heat conduction for similating heat up of wood particles at fast pyrolysis conditions. Code is grouped into 3 folders based on the heat transfer method used: analytical, numerical, or lumped capacitance method.

## analytical
Analytical solutions for transient heat conduction in a solid sphere or cylinder.

## numerical
Numerical solutions for transient heat conduction in a solid sphere or cylinder.

## lumped
Lumped capacitance method for transient conduction.
