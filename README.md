## 1D Transient Heat Conduction

Models and functions to simulate the 1D transient heat conduction of wood particles at fast pyrolysis conditions. The code is organized into 3 folders (see details below) based on the approach or method used. All code is written in Python 3. For easy installation of Python 3, use the [Anaconda](http://www.continuum.io) distribution available for free from Continuum Analytics. Please read the comments in each file to fully understand the limitations and assumptions made for each example. Each folder contains a **README** file to provide details about the files in that particular folder.

### analytical

### numerical
